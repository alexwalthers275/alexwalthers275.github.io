   <h1 align="center">hello world</h1> 
    <p>I am a photographer. I take photos of people for a small price. Some photographers over charge from 200 a hour to 2000 for a day. I think that is too pricey. I charge 100 for a whole day but I have discounts of 70 for people I know or people that found out about me through older clients. 
        To me I do photography because I have a good eye and I enjoy behind the camera more than in front. I used to model and I know how it feels to hate how the photographer thinks they are incharge when I would pay them for the photos. Why can they take the photos I want? That is the problem a lot of people have. One client complained to me how her last photographer would not let her do her own make up as she requested and the photographer was not only lazy and quick for the cash they over charged her and the photos did not turn out how the client wanted it. When I heard about this I wanted to be different. In my opinion I think as a photographer you should think about the client and not the money. If you are in it for the money you should not be doing photography and you should be doing something else. I do not get paid crazy money but that's not what I think about when I do it. I think about “is my client happy with these photos and are they getting their money's worth? I want not only to give my model/client the option to do their own clothing and make up or anything else they can also choose the poses and literally direct their own shoot. All I do is take photos and make sure the model approves of each one. First I'll take about 20 photos then take a sec to walk to my client and show them what I took so they can get run-throughs throughout the shoot to see if they like it, want more pics like that, or want to change something. It's good to keep letting them check up on their photos because they can’t see out the lens like you can. So you have to try to help them make sure that the angle you are taking it from works with them. Like sometimes my models will tell me “hey can we take the pic from a higher level or alex can you take more pics lower?” because some people have (good and bad sides) so you wanna make sure that they are comfortable with their pics. Because in this hobby as a photographer it should be all about the client not you.

        I have been doing photography for almost a year. I started my junior year of high school. It all started when I was at the mall with my dads friend's daughter. Now her dad is a music producer called The Dream, so her daughter has a lot of experience with the media. I brought my camera to the mall with me to make a youtube vlog for fun. As we started hanging more at the mall she suggested if i can take some photos of her for fun and i agreed. As I took photos I started to realize how good of an eye I had and how good my camera was.The photos struck a light bulb in my head and I was like “I can actually make something out of this. So that is where the idea of making a business out of this skill comes from. Further down the road I made an insta, tik tok, and small website for the business. Now the website was not crazy. I made it with some app online to make your own website. At first I did not have an ideal price so I would grade a price based on how far the drive was to the spot but now I charge just 100 for a day to keep it simple. But the idea of how this all started was as simple of wanting to make a business in order to help those who deserve good quality photos for a cheaper price and more control because photographers now not only give clients no control over their own photos that they are paying for they also get scammed with over priced charges and not super good photos.

        My rules are “the client is the director and is in charge” if you hire me you tell me what you want and what you need. If you want me to change the lighting, filtering, angel or even the idea you tell me and i do it. If you want someone to do your makeup I can hire someone but if you want to do it yourself then you can because it's your photos with your money and you deserve to get what you want. All my clients have had a positive interaction and outcome with my work. I have had zero negative reviews or experiences. Depending on the client I will talk alot or not talk much. Some people I can tell are not very social so I never want to overwhelm them with me talking to them so I try to be in and out. But if someone is more on the talkative side I will try to crack a joke now and then to get a natural smile for some photos. I do sometimes get some sneak attack photos aka taking photos when they are not expecting it just cuz sometimes you get lucky and get super good photos from just the model being natural. I have worked with all sorts of people like kids, teens and adults. Even some kids are hard to take photos of due to how much the move and squirm but I still make it work. I am able to work with many types of people. No one is impossible to take photos of nor is anyone not eligible to be a model. Anyone can truly be a model and everyone is beautiful no matter what. And that is what I try to prove through my photos.
